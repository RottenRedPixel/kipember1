# Mobile & iOS Rules

## Touch targets
Every tappable element must have a minimum tap area of 44×44px.
- Buttons: ensure `min-height: 44px` or Tailwind `h-11` / `py-3`
- Text-only links (e.g. "Sign In"): add `py-3 px-6` so the invisible tap area is large enough
- `<button>` elements always need `cursor: pointer` — iOS Safari won't fire tap events reliably without it

## NEVER use opacity transitions inside backdrop-filter containers
Animating `opacity` on any element inside a `backdrop-filter` parent is broken on both iOS and Android mobile browsers. The GPU compositor does not repaint children correctly. `will-change`, `translateZ(0)`, and other GPU-forcing hacks are NOT reliable fixes.

**The only reliable fix: use `color` transitions instead of `opacity`.**

```tsx
// BAD — broken on mobile inside backdrop-filter:
style={{ opacity: visible ? 1 : 0, transition: "opacity 0.8s ease" }}

// GOOD — works everywhere:
style={{ color: visible ? "#ffffff" : "transparent", transition: "color 0.8s ease" }}
```

This applies to ALL text that fades in/out inside any blurred/frosted container (modals, overlays, sheets).

## CSS animations inside backdrop-filter throttle the JS event loop on iOS
Running CSS `transform` or `animation` on many elements simultaneously inside a `backdrop-filter` container saturates the iOS GPU compositor, causing `setTimeout` / `setInterval` callbacks to be delayed or never fire.

**The fix: remove `backdrop-filter` from any container that also runs JS-timed state changes (e.g. auto-advancing text, countdowns). Use a solid/semi-opaque background instead.**

```tsx
// BAD — 30 animated bars inside backdrop-filter freezes JS timers on iOS:
style={{ backdropFilter: "blur(5px)", background: "rgba(0,0,0,0.75)" }}

// GOOD — solid background, no compositing overhead:
style={{ background: "rgba(18,18,18,0.97)" }}
```

## General interactive element checklist
- `<a>` / Next.js `<Link>`: renders as `<a>` — natively tappable, but still needs sufficient padding
- `<button>`: add `cursor: pointer` inline or via Tailwind `cursor-pointer`
- `<div onClick>`: avoid — use `<button>` instead; iOS won't fire click on a plain div

## NEVER use plain hover:opacity on interactive elements — scope to pointer devices only
On iOS/Android, CSS `:hover` activates on the **first tap** (changing opacity), and the click event only fires on the **second tap**. Users think the button is broken.

**Always scope opacity hover effects with `[@media(hover:hover)]`** so they only apply to real pointer devices (mouse/trackpad). Touch devices never match this query.

```tsx
// BAD — requires two taps on iOS:
<div className="opacity-60 hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-200">

// GOOD — use the can-hover utility class (defined in globals.css):
<div className="opacity-60 can-hover">
```

The `can-hover` class is defined in `globals.css` using `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` — it only applies on real pointer devices (mouse/trackpad), never on touch screens.

## Ember Chat workflow interactions — use Links, not onClick buttons
Inside the Ember Chat (which uses `backdrop-filter: blur`), `<button onClick>` with `useState` is **not reliable on iOS Safari or Android**. Touch events on onClick handlers fail silently.

**The only reliable fix: use URL-driven `<Link>` + `useSearchParams` instead of state.**

```tsx
// BAD — onClick inside backdrop-filter broken on mobile:
const [step, setStep] = useState(null);
<button onClick={() => setStep("adding")}>Add to Memory</button>

// GOOD — Link navigation works everywhere:
const step = useSearchParams().get("step");
<Link href="/ember/[id]?ember=owner&step=adding">Add to Memory</Link>
```

This pattern is used in all workflow components. State is read from the URL via `useSearchParams()`, and each choice navigates to a URL with a `step=` param (e.g. `step=adding`, `step=phone`, `step=chat`).

# Architecture

## Screen naming
The app has five top-level screens:

- **Landing Page** (`/`) — intro + sign up / sign in (unauthenticated)
- **Home Screen** (`/home`) — greeting dashboard for a signed-in user ("Hello {firstName}"), stats, activity, contributors grid
- **My Embers** (`/embers`) — grid / list of the user's embers (tabs for Mine / Shared)
- **Ember View** (`/ember/[id]`) — individual ember detail (photo, title, date) with the right rail (share, tend, view) and Ember Chat
- **Account** (`/account`) — profile + settings

Secondary routes (not in the five, but live in the app):
- Auth: `/signup`, `/signin`
- Marketing: `/about`
- Shared access: `/guest/[token]`, `/contribute/[token]`
- Sliders: `/tend/[action]` (ember-level), `/user/[action]` (user-level)

Legacy redirects in place:
- `/home?id=X[&...]` → `/ember/X[?...]`
- `/user/my-embers[?...]` → `/embers[?...]`
- `/user/shared-embers` → `/embers?view=shared`
- `/image/[id]` → `/ember/[id]`

## Slider pattern
All detail screens use a consistent slider panel: 93% width, 7% peek on the left to go back, header with back chevron + icon + title, scrollable content area.

### Slider button row rule
Action buttons at the bottom of a slider content area always split the full width equally using `flex`:

```tsx
// ALWAYS — buttons fill the row equally, right-aligned when fewer than full width
<div className="flex gap-3">
  <button className="flex-1 ...">Cancel</button>  // each gets equal share
  <button className="flex-1 ...">Save</button>
</div>

// Single button — takes half the width, right-aligned (push left with ml-auto):
<div className="flex">
  <button className="flex-1 ml-auto ...">Add Contributor</button>
</div>
// OR equivalently:
<div className="flex justify-end">
  <button className="w-1/2 ...">Add Contributor</button>
</div>
```

- 1 button → `w-1/2`, right-aligned (`ml-auto` or `justify-end`)
- 2 buttons → each `flex-1` (50/50 split)
- 3 buttons → each `flex-1` (33/33/33 split)

This ensures visual consistency across all sliders — a lone CTA is never full-width.

### Slider Save button — dirty state rule
The primary Save button is orange (`#f97316`) **only when the user has unsaved changes**. When no changes exist it renders as a muted dark button (`var(--bg-surface)` background, `1px solid var(--border-subtle)` border) and is disabled.

```tsx
// Pattern — compute isDirty, then apply conditionally:
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={handleSave}
  disabled={!isDirty}
  style={{
    background: isDirty ? '#f97316' : 'var(--bg-surface)',
    border: isDirty ? 'none' : '1px solid var(--border-subtle)',
    minHeight: 44,
    cursor: isDirty ? 'pointer' : 'default',
  }}
>
  Save
</button>
```

- `isDirty` compares **all editable fields** against the last-saved values (from `detail` or a `savedForm` snapshot), not just one field.
- The button label is always just **"Save"** — never "Save Title", "Save Location", etc.
- Applies to: Edit Title, Edit Snapshot, Edit Location, Edit Time & Date, and any future edit slider.

Structure: constants file (actions map + icons map) → dynamic `[action]` route → slider page.

- **Tend sliders** (`/tend/[action]`) — Add Content, View Wiki, Edit Snapshot, Tag People, Edit Title, Contributors, Settings
- **User sliders** (`/user/[action]`) — My Embers, Shared Embers, Create Ember, Profile
- Back links return to the modal that opened them (`/ember/[id]?m=tend` or `/ember/[id]?m=user`)

## Modals
URL-driven via `?m=` param on `/ember/[id]`. Current modals: `user`, `share`, `tend`, `play`.

Each modal uses the shared `<Modal>` wrapper (frosted glass card, X to close, centered at bottom). Items inside use `<SvgItem>` (icon + label in a 3-column grid).

## Ember Chat workflow pattern
The Ember Chat is a persistent shell at the bottom of Ember View. It has two parts:

1. **Shell** (Ember Chat component) — handles open/close toggle, flame button, container animation. Always the same regardless of workflow.
2. **Workflow slot** — an interchangeable inner component that renders the current workflow's UI.

### Workflow routing
Driven by URL param: `/ember/[id]?ember=owner`, `/ember/[id]?ember=contributor`, `/guest/{token}?ember=guest`, etc.

### Workflows
| Param | Component | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner` | OwnerFlow | Logged-in owner | Full chat history, phone call trigger, photo upload, voice input |
| `contributor` | ContributorFlow | Logged-in contributor | Full chat history, photo upload, voice input |
| `guest` | GuestFlow (in GuestEmberScreen) | Unauthenticated guest | Token-based, no persistent history, mic + text only |

### File structure
```
app/components/
  EmberChat.tsx               — shell (toggle, container, animation)
  workflows/
    OwnerFlow.tsx             — owner: full chat + phone call + photo upload
    ContributorFlow.tsx       — contributor: full chat + photo upload
    GuestFlow.tsx             — guest: token-based chat, no history
```

### Chat message formatting — Ember Chat and Story Circle must be identical

The live Ember Chat (`OwnerFlow.tsx`, `ContributorFlow.tsx`) and the Story Circle block in the wiki (`KipemberWikiContent.tsx`) must always match in message formatting. Any change to one must be applied to the other. Rules:

- **Sender label**: bold, white (`font-bold text-white`) for both ember and user/contributor
- **User/contributor bubbles**: `var(--bg-chat-user)` background, no border
- **Ember bubbles**: `var(--bg-ember-bubble)` background, `1px solid var(--border-ember)` border
- **Date dividers**: centered grey label (`text-white/25 text-[10px]`) when the date changes between messages
- **Time stamps**: grey (`text-white/25 text-[10px]`) under each bubble, aligned to the bubble's side — only rendered when `createdAt` is available

### Rules for workflows
- Each workflow is a standalone component in `app/components/workflows/`
- Receives `onClose` callback from the shell — the workflow never controls open/close
- Adding a new workflow = one new file + one entry in a lookup map in Ember Chat
- Shell handles all layout, animation, and backdrop — workflow only owns its inner content
- URL-driven so deep linking works (e.g. open app straight into recording)
